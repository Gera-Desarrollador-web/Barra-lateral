            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Client</li>
                <li>Server</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_already_know">
            <header>What you should already know
            </header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                not defined</code>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.</p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>Hello world

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
